# minibus-artem-vasin

Modeling and analyzing of public transport network by means of "minibus" tool of MATSim.

A recommended directory structure is as follows:
* `src` for sources
* `scenarios` for MATSim scenarios, i.e. MATSim input and output data.  A good way is the following:
  * One subdirectory for each scenario, e.g. `scenarios/mySpecialScenario01`.
  * This minimally contains a config file, a network file, and a population file.
  * Output goes to `output`.
